# Kaiburr Task 3 ‚Äì Web UI Frontend

This project implements a responsive and interactive web interface for the backend developed in **Task 1 (Java + Spring Boot)** and **Task 2 (Kubernetes)**.  
The application allows users to **create, view, search, delete, and run shell-command tasks**, displaying the corresponding execution output in real time.
